    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish that is beloved for its creamy texture and rich flavor. Made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper, it is a simple yet indulgent meal that has been enjoyed for generations. The origins of carbonara are somewhat debated, but it is widely believed to have been created in the mid-20th century in Rome. Some say it was invented by Italian charcoal workers, while others believe it was a result of American soldiers bringing bacon and eggs to Italy during World War II. Regardless of its origins, carbonara remains a favorite comfort food for many, thanks to its delicious combination of savory ingredients and its satisfying, hearty nature.</p>

        <li>1 cup Pecorino romano cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup pancietta</li>
        <li>1 tbs black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbs olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tbs salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 cup basil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup onion</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white win</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup grated cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>

    <h3>Steps to making Carbonara</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, about 8-10 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain the rest.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and Pecorino Romano cheese until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and add the cooked spaghetti to the pancetta and garlic mixture. Toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, stirring quickly to create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add some reserved pasta water, a little at a time, until desired consistency is reached.</li>
        <li>Season with black pepper and salt to taste. Add parsley and basil, and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with additional grated cheese and a squeeze of lemon juice if desired.</li>
    </ol>
