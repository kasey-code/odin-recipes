    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish that is beloved for its creamy texture and rich flavor. Made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper, it is a simple yet indulgent meal that has been enjoyed for generations. The origins of carbonara are somewhat debated, but it is widely believed to have been created in the mid-20th century in Rome. Some say it was invented by Italian charcoal workers, while others believe it was a result of American soldiers bringing bacon and eggs to Italy during World War II.
